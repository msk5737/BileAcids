This repo is for the BA_sFMT_invitro experiment run on Dec 11, 2022.

This repository contains the .Rmd files used for data analysis for the bile acid quantitation of sFMT invitro experiment.

Experiment details:

37 strains of sFMT and 22 subgroups contains those strains were OD-normalized and incubated in a 96-well plate for 48 hours in BHI CHV media containing the following bile acids:
CA-d5
CDCA-d5
DCA
LCA
GCA
TCA

see BAmetadata and samplemetadata for more info


The strains were extracted and the bile acids were quantitated using targeted metabolomics approach using ThermoFisher TSQ triplequad.

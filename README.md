### BileAcids
This project aims to dissect the bile acid metabolism by the human gut microbiome.

This repository contains the .Rmd files used for data analysis for the bile acid quantitation of sFMT invitro experiment.

Experiment details:

37 strains of sFMT and 22 subgroups contains those strains were OD-normalized and incubated in a 96-well plate for 48 hours in BHI CHV media containing the following bile acids:
CA-d5
CDCA-d5
DCA
LCA
GCA
TCA

see BAmetadata and samplemetadata for more info


The strains were extracted and the bile acids were quantitated using targeted metabolomics approach using ThermoFisher TSQ triplequad.
